# What is COD?

Cash on delivery (COD) is a type of transaction in which the recipient makes payment for a good at the time of delivery. If the purchaser does not make payment when the good is delivered, the good is returned to the seller. The COD method is used by many businesses that sell goods through a catalog or online.
